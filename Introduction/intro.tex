I am having my Six Weeks Training at Testing And Consultancy Cell at Guru Nanak Dev
Engineering College Ludhiana. Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was established by the
Nankana Sahib Education Trust (NSET) Ludhiana. The Nankana Sahib Education Trust (NSET)
was founded in the memory of the most sacred temple of Sri Nankana Sahib, birth place of Sri Guru
Nanak Dev Ji. With the mission of ``Removal of Economic Backwardness through Technology''
